New functionality provided by OpenGL ES 3.0 specification includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Instanced Rendering – less draw calls to render the same geometry multiple times (think of big crowd of people where each one of them differs in model matrix and a few appearance attributes (e.g. a texture layer of a texture array) rendered with one call), very good presentation was shown by \emph{PowerVR Graphics} \cite{powervr_graphics} on their Metropolis Demo \cite{powervr_metropolis} with instancing of big sky scrapers,
\item Transform Feedback – stores the primitives generated by the Vertex Processing step(s), recording data from those primitives into Buffer Objects.
This allows one to preserve the post-transform rendering state of an object and resubmit this data multiple times.
\item more internal texture formats (including new compression modes: ETC2/EAC),
\item a new version of the GLSL: ES 300 (shading language) based on GLSL 330 from desktop GL,
\item Multiple Render Targets (MRT) – needed to render to multiple textures at once, e.g. for deferred shading,
\item enhanced texturing functionality,
\item Uniform Buffer Objects – e.g. useful for simpler handling of uniforms shared over multiple programs,
\item and many others not mentioned here for brevity.
\end{itemize}
